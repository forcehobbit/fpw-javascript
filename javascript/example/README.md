# List and Detail View example

## Serve the App
Run this example by serving the root directory of the app using your favorite server.

If you don't have a favorite serving method, you may find an express server configuration already set up for you.
Follow these steps to run the application:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#nvm)
    - Using `nvm` to install Node.js is the recommended method, as it allows to switch versions on a project basis
    - If it is not possible to use `nvm` on your system, you may check the `.nvmrc` file to identify the `Node.js` version 
      required for this app
2. Run the `npm install` command from the root directory of the example
    - This will install the required dependencies in the `node_modules` directory
3. Run the `npm start` command to run the application

If the configured port is conflicting with other applications on your machine, you may change it in the `server.js` 
file.
